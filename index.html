        <p><b>Aim:</b>
            <br>We are checking how we can use swipe movements in response inhibition tasks. Later on we might be able
            to use this for interesting psychological measurements.
            <br>Participants have to respond with touchscreen presses to items appearing on the screen.
        </p>

        <p><b>Payment:</b>
            <br>
            The task takes around 5 minutes.
            <span id="pay_info">

                    We could not detect your Prolific ID!

                are trying to do this test as a job via Prolific and want to be
                compensated, you should open the proper link provided.

        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <p>
            Please place your smartphone on a table (or other solid surface).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the task, you will see the following displayed on the screen.
        </p>

        <div class="flick-frame-class flick-frame-demo">
            <div class="flick-left-line flick-line"></div>
            <div class="flick-right-line flick-line"></div>
            <button class="flick-button-circle"></button>
        </div>


        <p>
            At the beginning of each trial, you should place your preferred index finger on the circle at the bottom.
            (If you would like, you may use your middle finger instead of index finger.)
            Almost immediately after your finger touch is detected, you will get a "↑" message, as below. This means you
            should start moving your finger up, toward the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <div class="flick-frame-class flick-frame-demo">
            <div class="flick-stim-class">↑</div>
            <div class="flick-left-line flick-line"></div>
            <div class="flick-right-line flick-line"></div>
            <button class="flick-button-circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>

            Right after you start moving your finger, the arrow will change into a left arrow (←) or a right arrow (→)
            displayed on the
            screen. As soon as you see this, move your finger, as fast as you can, to the corresponding direction (to
            the left for left arrow, to the right for right arrow). Your finger should cross either the left or the
            right vertical line (in green).
        </p>

        <p>
            Start the practice with the <b>Start</b> button below.
        </p>

        <br>
        <button type="button" class="main_button" onclick='begin();'>Start</button>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="instructions2_sst" class="longtext" style="display:none;">
        <p>
            For the rest of the task, on some trials, very shortly after the left or right arrow appears, the frame will
            become red and there will
            appear an "X" sign on each side of the arrow, representing a "STOP" signal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like this:
        </p>

        <div class="flick-frame-class flick-frame-demo" style="background-color: red;">
            <div class="flick-stim-class">x ← x</div>
            <div class="flick-left-line flick-line"></div>
            <div class="flick-right-line flick-line"></div>
            <button class="flick-button-circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Or like this:
        </p>

        <div class="flick-frame-class flick-frame-demo" style="background-color: red;">
            <div class="flick-stim-class">x → x</div>
            <div class="flick-left-line flick-line"></div>
            <div class="flick-right-line flick-line"></div>
            <button class="flick-button-circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>
            When this happens, please try your best to stop your response and <i>not press</i> any button on that trial.
            It is normal and expected if you will not always be able to successfully stop when a stop signal
            appears. However, if you continue to try very hard to stop when a stop signal appears, you
            should be able to stop sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Please balance the requirement to respond quickly and accurately to the arrows while trying very hard to
                stop to the stop signal.
            </b>
        </p>

        <br>
        <button type="button" class="main_button" onclick='begin();'>Start</button>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="instructions2_flank_2" class="longtext" style="display:none;">
        <p>
            For the entire rest of the task, the single arrow will be surrounded by additional "flanker" arrows on both
            sides. There
            are four possible variations: <b>→→→→→</b>, <b>←←←←←</b>, <b>→→←→←</b>, <b>←←→←←</b>.
            <b>Pay close
                attention to the central arrow only.</b>
            Just like in the practice phase, the central arrow will change
            direction right after you start moving your finger. Ignore the flanker arrows; they are not important for
            your decision.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                As quickly as you can, move your finger in the direction indicated by the central arrow: left for a left
                arrow (←) and right for a right arrow (→). The task will move on regardless of whether you respond
                correctly. Nonetheless, please remember: your finger should cross either the left or the right vertical
                line (in green) to make a correct response.
