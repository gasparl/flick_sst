        <h1>Information</h1>

        <p>
            (This is a demo version of the application; more or less compatible with all devices.)
        </p>

        <p><b>Aim:</b>
            <br>We are checking how we can use swipe movements in response inhibition tasks. Later on we might be able
            to use this for interesting psychological measurements.
            <br>Participants have to respond with touchscreen presses to items appearing on the screen.
        </p>

        <p><b>Payment:</b>
            <br>
            The task takes around 3 minutes.
            <span id="pay_info">

                    We could not detect your Prolific ID!
                </b> Therefore we will assume that this is a voluntary testing and you will not receive payment. If you
                are trying to do this test as a job via Prolific and want to be
                compensated, you should open the proper link provided.

        </p>

        <p><b>Rights:</b>
            <br>You can stop participating in the study at any time without giving a reason (by closing or refreshing
            this website). In this case, all recorded data will be fully deleted.
            <br>This application was tested thoroughly, but we cannot guarantee that it will correctly work with your
            specific device and operating system. Please contact lkcsgaspar@gmail.com if you run into any trouble.
        </p>

        <p><b>Anonymity and Privacy:</b>
            <br>The results of the study (touch movement data) are used and published for research purposes. The data do
            not provide any information about you personally. Your identity will be kept strictly confidential.
        </p>

        <p><b>Consent:</b>
            <br>By clicking the "Consent & Continue" button, you declare that you have read and understood the
            information above. You confirm that you will be concentrating on the task and complete it to the best of
            your abilities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <button type="button" class="main_button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('intro_id').style.display = 'none';window.scrollTo(0, 0);document.getElementById('instructions_id').style.display = 'block';">
            Consent & Continue
        </button>

        <br>

    <div id="instructions_id" class="longtext" style="display:none;">

        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <p>
            Please place your smartphone on a table (or other solid surface).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the task, you will see the following displayed on the screen.
        </p>

        <div class="frame_class frame_demo">
            <div class="left_line"></div>
            <div class="right_line"></div>
            <button class="button_circle"></button>
        </div>


        <p>
            At the beginning of each trial, you should place your preferred index finger on the circle at the bottom.
            (If you would like, you may use your middle finger instead of index finger.)
            Almost immediately after your finger touch is detected, you will get a "↑" message, as below. This means you
            should start moving your finger up, toward the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <div class="frame_class frame_demo">
            <div class="stimulus_class">↑</div>
            <div class="left_line"></div>
            <div class="right_line"></div>
            <button class="button_circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>

            Right after you start moving your finger, the arrow will change into a left arrow (←) or a right arrow (→)
            displayed on the
            screen. As soon as you see this, move your finger, as fast as you can, to the corresponding direction (to
            the left for left arrow, to the right for right arrow). Your finger should cross either the left or the
            right vertical line (in green).
        </p>

        <p>
            Start the practice with the <b>Start</b> button below.
        </p>

        <br>
        <button type="button" class="main_button" onclick='begin();'>Start</button>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="instructions2_id" class="longtext" style="display:none;">
        <p>
            For the rest of the task, on some trials, very shortly after the left or right arrow appears, there will
            appear an "X" sign on each side of the arrow, representing a "STOP" signal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like this:
        </p>

        <div class="frame_class frame_demo">
            <div class="stimulus_class">x ← x</div>
            <div class="left_line"></div>
            <div class="right_line"></div>
            <button class="button_circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Or like this:
        </p>

        <div class="frame_class frame_demo">
            <div class="stimulus_class">x → x</div>
            <div class="left_line"></div>
            <div class="right_line"></div>
            <button class="button_circle"></button>
        </div>

        <p>
            When this happens, please try your best to stop your response and <i>not press</i> any button on that trial.
            It is normal and expected if you will not always be able to successfully stop when a stop signal
            appears. However, if you continue to try very hard to stop when a stop signal appears, you
            should be able to stop sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Please balance the requirement to respond quickly and accurately to the arrows while trying very hard to
                stop to the stop signal.
            </b>
        </p>

        <br>
        <button type="button" class="main_button" onclick='begin();'>Start</button>
        <br>
